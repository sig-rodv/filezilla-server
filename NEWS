1.6.1 (2022-12-07)

- MSW: Fixed an installation issue due to a service handle not being closed

1.6.0 (2022-12-06)

+ UI: it's now possible to upload TLS certificates to the server directly from the UI, using a specific selector in the Security page of the protocols configuration.
+ UI: the maximum amount of characters in all text controls has been limited to a sensible number, so to avoid potential crashes or stalls in corner cases. 
- Fixed potential issues with locking of mutexes in the administration protocol
- MSW: the installer now works properly also if the uninstaller from a previous installation has been deleted.

+ MSW: the installer now offers to keep the existing service configuration of a previously installed FileZilla Server whose release must be above or equal to 1.6.0.
+ UI: the main window position and size is now remembered across different runs.
+ UI: the server configuration can now be exported to a file and imported into another server. It is possible to select the specific parts of the configuration that are to be exported or imported.

In case of pre-existing conflicts in the configuration file, the administration listeners take precedence, so that it is still possible to change the FileZilla Server's configuration.
- UI: in some corner cases concurrently opening dialogs could cause instabilities. These dialogs are now queued up and opened sequentially.

+ Server: Implemented throttling of login attempts in case of too many failed attempts. 
+ Server: The version number in the welcome message can now be manually suppressed by setting the "has_version" attribute of the message field in the configuration file to "false".
+ MSW: If the service is running under the SYSTEM account, configuration files are now placed under %PROGRAMDATA%\filezilla-server. This is to workaround the issue that when doing a Windows Update the settings could be wiped out. Settings still residing under %LOCALAPPDATA%\filezilla-server are automatically migrated.
+ Communication with the impersonator child process is now asynchronous
+ Admin UI: The password fields in the configuration dialog now shows a hint to inform the user about how to keep the existing password

- When using the command line parameter --config-version-check ignore, the expected version is now written to the settings files if a mismatch is detected

1.4.1 (2022-05-06)

- Admin UI: Fixed a crash on the listener page
- Admin UI: Improved workflow for changing user passwords
- MSW: Fixed an issue with the converter for configurations from FileZilla Server 0.9.x

1.4.0 (2022-04-29)

- Mac: fixed regression that made the installed service not startable
- Admin UI: changed wording in the logging settings
- Admin UI: made default connection values correct, in case the settings file is missing.
- MSW: fixed various bug in the ExecDos plugin, that could cause the admin password not to be set properly.
- MSW: non-ASCII admin passwords can now be properly used.
- MSW: fixed a bug in libfilezilla that caused an unexpected failure when creating directories with restricted access. It had effects on the ACME account creation. 

1.4.0-rc1 (2022-04-20)

! MSW: the installer doesn't rely on the PATH environment variable to find the tools it needs, but refers to them absolutely, to avoid hijacking.
+ The size of the TCP buffer sizes on the sockets used for data transfers can now be specified
+ Configuration files are now tagged with a "flavour" and a version number. The Server will refuse to load configuration files with a different flavour than its own or with a version higher than its own. The server's option --config-version-check can be used to control this functionality: if specified, the server checks the versioning, performs the required action and then exit, unless its action is 'ignore'. If the action is 'error', it just checks whether the versions are ok. If the action is 'backup', then a backup of the files is made if the versions are not ok. The parameter --config-version-check-result-file is used to specify a file in which the result of the version check has to be put. If the file contains 'ok', then everything went file. If the file contains 'error', then there was an error. If the file contains 'backup', then a backup was made. The installer makes use of this functionality.
+ Admin UI: the selected log entries can now be copied to the clipboard, in CSV, HTML and plaintext formats through the context menu
+ Admin UI: the settings dialog layout has been changed to accomodate for future other protocol settings, factoring out the settings that are common to all protocols.
+ Admin UI: adjusted borders and spacing to look better on HiDPI displays.
+ Admin UI: preserve the fingerprints of the previously connected servers. The connection dialog gives hints when inputing the host and port.
+ Log files can optionally be rotated daily instead of by size
+ Added option to specify a default user to impersonate if a user logs in with an account that does not use impersonation
- MSW: The installer not detects and rejects 32bit Windows
- MSW, Admin UI: No more double error message when a validation error occurs
- Admin UI: Solved a crash and fixed other bugs related to minimzing the main window to the notification area

- FTP: QUIT needs to respond with 221, not 200
- Bug fixes to the internal HTTP library

- Fixed a confusing error message in some situations if trying to list non-existing directories
- Admin UI: fixed regression that caused the progress bar not to show on downloads from the server.

+ Configuration wizard to setup passive mode
+ Linux: Warn if sysctl knob kernel.yama.ptrace_scope is 0
+ Linux: Refuse to run if sysctl knob fs.protected_hardlinks is 0
- Admin UI: Rejecting a certificate fingerprint prompt no longer triggers automatic reconnects

1.3.0-rc1 (2022-02-03)

! The internal tool filezilla-server-crypt now accepts the password from stdin, not anymore as a parameter, to avoid password leaking.
! Mountpoints are now impossible to rename or delete.
+ The configuration files can now be reloaded without shutting down the service first. To make it work, send the SIGHUP signal to the service process on nix, send the paramchange control message to the service on Windows (i.e. 'sc control filezilla-server paramchange').
+ The UI now automatically attempts to reconnect to the server if the connection is lost
+ MSW: users are now case-insensitive
+ Mac: created an installer
+ Display the administration TLS certificate fingerprints at installation time, so that they can be taken note of.
+ Negotiate custom ALPN with FileZilla Client, this allows saving a few round-trips during connection establishment
- Warn if no administration password has been given during installation.
- In TVFS, fixed implicit root "/" not being accessible, trac #12617.
- In TVFS, an implicit mountpoint whose parent is non-recursive is now able to be listed and cwd'd into.

- Fixed regressions in the UI related to the TLS certificates generation.
- MSW: the installer now correctly support the /D parameter, used to define a different default installation directory from the command line.
